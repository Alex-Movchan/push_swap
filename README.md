# push_swap

To accomplish this task, I used the quicksort algorithm.
But executed twice, leaving 2 or 3 numbers in the stack
This is because you need to complete up to 700 operations per 100 numbers
5000 operation per 500 numbers
Ð¢he checker has the flags of the console visualization.
-d color
-a first and last stack
-c last stack
-v stack after each operation
-count count operation
Flags can be combined
